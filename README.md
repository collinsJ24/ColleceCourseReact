# React App for College Course API service

This project has been created to test and showcase the use of the College Course API service.
It gives the user the opportunity to choose from a list of Colleges, which will then use the API service to retrieve the list of all its college courses

The app is currently deployed on Heroku here: https://infinite-meadow-96759.herokuapp.com/

It uses the following API service, which must also be deployed to allow db retrieval:  https://rocky-depths-80035.herokuapp.com/

As the app uses the free tier Heroku, it takes about 30 seconds to sping up a container.
